# Cyclistic Bike-Share Capstone Project

## Overview

This project is part of the **Capstone Project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. As a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team at **Cyclistic**, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago, the goal of this project is to analyze the usage patterns of casual riders versus annual members and to provide recommendations for marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Project Description

**Cyclistic** operates a bike-share program with a fleet of over **5,800 bicycles** and **600 docking stations** across Chicago. The company aims to maximize the number of annual memberships by understanding how different types of users utilize the bike-sharing service.

### Key Objectives

- Analyze and identify trends in bike usage for casual riders and annual members.
- Provide data-driven insights and visualizations to support marketing strategy recommendations.

### Data Sources

The analysis uses **Cyclisticâ€™s Historical Trip Data**, which includes:

- Data from the previous **12 months** (January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023).
- A total of **12 CSV files**, each representing one month of data.

## Data Preparation

### Data Structure and Organization

- The data is structured and organized into individual CSV files.
- Each dataset contains information such as `ride_id`, `rideable_type`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `member_casual`, `ride_length`, `day_of_week`, and `weekday`.

### Data Reliability

- Data is sourced from a real bike-sharing company in Chicago and is deemed **Reliable, Original, Current, and Cited** (ROCCC).
- Limitations include the lack of financial data and personally identifiable information (PII) due to data privacy regulations.

## Analysis Process

The analysis follows the steps of the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act**.
