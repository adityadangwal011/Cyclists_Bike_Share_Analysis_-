# Cyclistic Bike-Share Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the usage patterns of casual riders versus annual members of **Cyclistic**, a bike-share program in Chicago. The goal is to provide insights that will inform marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Project Description

**Cyclistic** operates a bike-share program with a fleet of over **5,800 bicycles** and **600 docking stations** across Chicago. The primary goal of this project is to understand how casual riders and annual members use the bike-sharing service differently.

### Key Objectives

- Analyze trends in bike usage for casual riders and annual members.
- Provide data-driven insights and visualizations to support marketing strategy recommendations aimed at increasing annual memberships.

### Data Sources

The analysis uses **Cyclisticâ€™s Historical Trip Data**, which spans:

- The previous **12 months** (January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023).
- A total of **12 CSV files**, each containing one month's data.

## Data Preparation

### Data Structure and Organization

- The data is structured and organized into individual CSV files.
- Each dataset contains fields such as `ride_id`, `rideable_type`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `member_casual`, `ride_length`, `day_of_week`, and `weekday`.

### Data Reliability

- The data is sourced from a real bike-sharing company in Chicago and is deemed **Reliable, Original, Current, and Cited** (ROCCC).
- Some limitations include the lack of financial data and personally identifiable information (PII) due to data privacy regulations.

## Analysis Process

The analysis follows the steps of the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act**.
